### Description:

It's a Tic Tac Toe game that practices and demonstrates some jQuery and HTML coding.  First the players add in their names and choose colors.  Each time a player clicks on one of the Tic Tac Toe grid squares, the HTML is appended so that their X or O marker appears, the turn property of the board prototype is changed, and the "winner" function is run on the board to see if a victory is yet decided.


### Setup:

* _Clone directory from "https://github.com/DillonLloydLee/Tic_Tac_Toe.git"_
* _Open the index.html file._
* _To run tests, open the spec-runner.html file in the spec folder._
* _That's it!  Run this program from the page and follow onscreen directions._


### Technologies Used:

JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Mocha, Chai.
